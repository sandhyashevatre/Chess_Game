# Chess_Game
Learn the Portable Game Notation (PGN) format for recording a chess game. Write a parser for a pgn file which can show the state of the chessboard after each move.

It should be able to read the input from a file.
It should be able to parse it piecewise, i.e., move by move
It should alert you (and raise an exception) whenever there’s an invalid move. This could be tricky and typically needs you to code the logic of which pieces are allowed to move where.
It is recommended to work in pairs and create an object oriented design for the parsing system.
Don’t panic, this is just a complex version of the tic-tac-toe parser you already wrote.
